## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare R2 File Storage

- All user files are stored in Cloudflare R2, a highly scalable, S3-compatible object storage solution.
- The backend uses the AWS SDK to upload, stream, and manage files in R2.
- File upload, preview, and download routes interact directly with R2 for efficient, scalable storage.
- The architecture is ready for direct-to-R2 uploads (bypassing server RAM/disk for large files).
- Files can be served via a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) for fast, global access.
- Easily switch to other S3-compatible storage if needed.
